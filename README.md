Practice 
This is a practice project for me. I am currently new at coding and I want to get better. I want to be able to make mistakes, learn from them, and improve myself. Perfection is now on the back burner. It's not frowned upon but I do embrace it along with imperfection. Remember, you are human. You will make mistakes. Learn from them and move on to bigger, better things.
